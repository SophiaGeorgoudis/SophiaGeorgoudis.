## ***Neuroscience and Law***
## 5th Year, first Year Masters in Neuroscience
### I enrolled in this course to gain more knowledge of neural data science to aid in my future goals in the field of neuroscience. I also want to complete the neurotechnology and innovation certificate and this course was one of many courses that can statisfy that requirement. 
### Mental illness and mental health is what got me interested in neuroscience. My passion is geared toward helping this population by focusing more on psychotherapy rather than prescribed psychoactive drugs. Addtionally, I want to have a voice in promoting more rehabilitation than retribution in regards to the jusitce system for this population as I want to make a positve difference in this ever-changing world and be that change. Mental health is very important to me and I value the efforts made to assist this population in the most healthiest means possible. 
### After I finish my Masters, my plan is to go to law school. From there, I hope to have a respected voice in the justice system by advocating for individuals suffering with psychiatric disabilities.
